Task ID: 3434925
The client needs a quick way to visualize its vendors when creating an RFQ. They are looking forward to implementing a checkbox to easily toggle on or off if a contact is a vendor.Â 

During the Purchase workflow, when selecting a vendor, the client also wants to filter the contacts available to select from; only contacts marked as vendors in the previous checkbox will be visible to the user to select.
